This is work-in-progress! Warning This document assumes you have a general idea of how Ithkuil noun derivation works. I will rephrase stuff later to ger rid of this assumption. Phonology Consonants Here is the consonant table: The consonants are: b c c\u030c d \u0111 f g h j k l l\u0327 m n n\u030c p r s s\u030c t t\u0327 v w x y z z\u030c z\u0307 \u2018 . c makes the sound [ts] j makes the sound [d\u0292] r makes the sound [\u027e] or [r] y makes the sound [j] \u010d makes the sound [t\u0283] \u0111 makes the sound [\u00f0] \u013c makes the sound [\u026c] \u0148 makes the sound [\u014b] \u0161 makes the sound [\u0283] \u0163 makes the sound [\u03b8] \u017c makes the sound [dz] \u017e makes the sound [\u0292]. Aspiration and Palatalization The sounds m, n, p, t, b, d, z\u0307, j, c, c\u030c, v, f, \u0111, t\u0327, z, s, l\u0327, z\u0327, z\u030c, s\u030c, x, h are capable of being palatalized. Palatalization can either be marked with \u02b8 or with a circumflex. When you need to use a circumflex on top of a letter with a caron or breve, the diacritics turn to a ring. Vowels The base vowels are: a a\u0307 \u00e4 \u0103/\u044a \u00e5 e \u0115 \u0117 \u00eb i\u0328 i \u012d \u00ef o o\u0307 \u00f6 u u\u0307 \u00fc \u016d a\u0307 makes the sound [\u0251] or [ai] \u00e4 makes the sound [\u00e6] \u0103/\u044a make the sound [\u0264] or [au] \u00e5 makes the sound [\u0254] or [oi] \u0115 makes the sound [\u025b] or [ei] \u0117 makes the sound [eu] \u00eb make the sound [\u0259] or [\u028c] i\u0308 makes the sound [\u026f] \u012d makes the sound [\u026a] or [oa] i\u0328 makes the sound [\u0268] o\u0307 makes the sound [\u0153] or [ou] \u00f6 makes the sound [\u00f8] u\u0307 makes the sound [\u0289] or [ui] \u00fc makes the sound [y] \u016d makes the sound [\u028a] or [ue]. It is permissible to write the dipthongs as two seperate letters (\u201c\u00e5\u201d as \u201coi\u201d), but this is only meant for informal writing. Nasalization and Length All vowels are capable of nasalization and length. Length is marked with a macron (a\u0304, e\u0304, i\u0304). If you can\u2019t use a macron, either an under-diaresis (i\u0324, o\u0324, u\u0324) or a colon (i:, o:, u:) is acceptable. Morphology I II III IV V VI VII . .

But while every Ithkuil root has to conform to the same root template with 3 stems and 4 specifications, Khal roots don\u2019t have this limitation. Every root could (hypothetically) have from 1 to 80 stemlets though roots rarely reach those extremes. While roots could also hypothetically be randomly organised, each root generally fits into a set of templates. Here is the table of the root -KH-: Stem 1: Stem 2: Stem 3: A language of khal khal word grammar of khal Basic use(age) of khal use(age) of khal word use(age) of khal grammar Content medium of khal (paper, sound) (be) medium of khal word (paper, sound) (be) medium of khal grammar (paper, sound) Constitutor utter(ance of) khal utter(ance) of khal word discuss(ion) of khal grammar Object speaker of khal speaker of khal word grammarian of khal Person The letter \u201cA\u201d in the right corner signifies that this fits in the A template of roots. Here is the template of A roots: Stem 1: Stem 2: Stem 3: A sl 1 sl 6 sl 11 Basic sl 2 sl 7 sl 12 Content sl 3 sl 8 sl 13 Constitutor sl 4 sl 9 sl 14 Object sl 5 sl 10 sl 15 Person sl stands for stemlet here. Check out Root Templates for the list of all root templates. Here is the root -MR- (\u2018DOMESTIC CAT\u2019) that I will use in most examples: Stem 1: Stem 2: Stem 3: Stem 4: Stem 5: Stem 6: A6 domestic cat food of domestic cat toy of domestic cat (do) the action of meowing (do) the action of purring (do) the action of chirping Basic essence of domestic cat ingredient of cat food components of cat toy the sound of the meow the sound of the purring the sound of the chirp Content body of domestic cat container of cat food box of cat toy the meowing cat the cat that purrs the cat that chirps Constitutor act as domestic cat making cat food playing with cat toy hearing the meow hearing the purr (action of) hearing the chirp Object friend of domestic cat buy(er) of cat food buy(er) of cat toy the entity that causes the cat to meow the entity that causes the cat to purr the entity that causes the cat to chirp Person Note Roots can never have palatal consonants!

Yes. Did it do the action? No. So it is a patient. amre Experiencer The entity who was forced to experience something. \u201c The cat sneezed \u201d. Did the cat do the action? Not really. It sneezed without his will. So the cat is the experiencer. amru Representer Quote from Ithkuil: \u201cIt indicates the party/entity/idea/thought/situation or mental state which triggers an unwilled, affective response or is the trigger for an existential states with no tangibly affected patient\u201d. For example: \u201c The hammer exemplifies toolship \u201d: The hammer neither does anything or is getting affected. It rather triggers or represents the idea of what it means to be a tool. \u201c The cat possesses a toy \u201d: The cat is neither the doer or the doee here. The cat owning a toy triggers the state of possession. \u201c That book contains poems \u201d: The poems that are in the book trigger the state of containing something. Hope I explained it well enough. amra\u0306 Effector The entity is changing or affecting the patient in some way. \u201c Kate hits the cat :( \u201d Kate here has unfortunately affected the cat by hitting it. amri Reciever The entity that is recieveing something as a result of communication, transfer, transmisison or trade. Some examples: Give the dog a bone, I\u2019ll tell her your secret, The host introduced me to the guests. amri\u0308 Double-roled Simultaneously the effector and the patient. For example: \u201c She dressed herself \u201d: She both dressed someone and got dressed herself. \u201c We talked for a few minutes \u201d: That \u201cwe\u201d has both the talker and the listener inside of it so it counts. *amro\u0308* Object Tool Patient Experiencer Representer Effector Receiver Double-Rolled a o e u a\u0306 i i\u0308 o\u0308 Locational Direction of Movement To Specifies direction towards.

That\u2019s how you derive adjectives like \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201c34\u201d from \u201cgreenness\u201d or \u201c34-ness\u201d Conjunction Turns it into a conjunctor that takes two inputs from both sides. This is meant to be used with roots like \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d, but you could technically use this case with every root. Though the meaning of that conjunction would be up to the speaker. 1 For example: mro\u0308i\u0308 : [cat conjunction] Equative Forms phrases like \u201c as \u2018X property\u2019 as \u2026 \u201c For example: mri\u0308akh : as cat-ic as Khal. description conjunction equative o\u0308a\u0308 o\u0308i\u0308 i\u0308a Configuration When the configuration is omitted, it is assumed to be a monad (a single entity). Numbers Monad Default value. Has the consonant value -l- . Represents a single entity. amral ( amra / amr ): a cat. Dyad Represents two entities treated as a unit. amrat : a pair of cats. Triad Represents three entities treated as a unit. amra\u0111 : a group of three cats. Polyad Represents more than 6 entities as a unit. amraw : a group of more than 6 cats. Pleiad Represents one than one entity as a unit. amrah : a group of more than 1 cat. Hikanad Represents an enough amount of entities as a unit.
