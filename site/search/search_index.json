Aspiration and Palatalization The sounds p , t , k\u0327 , k , q , c , c\u0307 , c\u030c are capable of being aspirated. Aspiration can either be marked with \u02b0 ( p\u02b0 , t\u02b0 , k\u02b0 , k\u0327\u02b0 , q\u02b0 , c\u02b0 , c\u0307\u02b0 , c\u030c\u02b0 ), or can be marked with an undercaron ( p\u032c , t\u032c , k\u032c , k\u0327\u032c , q\u032c , c\u032c , c\u0307\u032c , c\u030c\u032c ).

Nasalization and Length All vowels are capable of nasalization and length. Nasals are marked with an ogonek (a\u0328, \u00f6\u0328, \u00e5\u0328). If you are unable use an ogonek, a tilde is acceptable (u\u0303, \u044a\u0303). Length is marked with a macron (a\u0304, e\u0304, i\u0304). If you can\u2019t use a macron, an under-diaresis is acceptable (i\u0324, o\u0324, u\u0324). Nasals and length can be on the same letter. Morphology I II III IV V VI VII . .

But while every Ithkuil root has to conform to the same root template with 3 stems and 4 specifications, Khal roots don\u2019t have this limitation. Every root could (hypothetically) have from 1 to 128 stemlets though roots rarely reach those extremes. While roots could also hypothetically be randomly organised, each root generally fits into a set of templates. Here is the table of the root -K\u032c- (-K\u02b0-): Stem 1: Stem 2: Stem 3: A language of k\u02b0al k\u02b0al word grammar of k\u02b0al Basic use(age) of k\u02b0al use(age) of k\u02b0al word use(age) of k\u02b0al grammar Content medium of k\u02b0al (paper, sound) (be) medium of k\u02b0al word (paper, sound) (be) medium of k\u02b0al grammar (paper, sound) Constitutor utter(ance of) k\u02b0al utter(ance) of k\u02b0al word discuss(ion) of k\u02b0al grammar Object speaker of k\u02b0al speaker of k\u02b0al word grammarian of k\u02b0al Person The letter \u201cA\u201d in the right corner signifies that this fits in the A template of roots. Here is the template of A roots: Stem 1: Stem 2: Stem 3: A sl 1 sl 6 sl 11 Basic sl 2 sl 7 sl 12 Content sl 3 sl 8 sl 13 Constitutor sl 4 sl 9 sl 14 Object sl 5 sl 10 sl 15 Person sl stands for stemlet here.

The (usually inanimate) participant of the sentence which isn\u2019t really affected or does anything. For example: \u201c Kate wants the cat . \u201d. Is the cat aware of this? Maybe. Is it affected, i.e. is it changed in any way? No. Did the cat do anything? No. So it is an object here. amra Tool The thing used to do the action. The pen in \u201c He signed the document with his pen \u201d. amro : \u201cusing the cat\u201d Patient The entity affected by the action. \u201c Kate fed the cat \u201d. Did the cat got affected? Yes. Did it do the action? No. So it is a patient. amre Experiencer The entity who was forced to experience something. \u201c The cat sneezed \u201d. Did the cat do the action? Not really. It sneezed without his will. So the cat is the experiencer. amru Representer Quote from Ithkuil: \u201cIt indicates the party/entity/idea/thought/situation or mental state which triggers an unwilled, affective response or is the trigger for an existential states with no tangibly affected patient\u201d. For example: \u201c The hammer exemplifies toolship \u201d: The hammer neither does anything or is getting affected. It rather triggers or represents the idea of what it means to be a tool. \u201c The cat possesses a toy \u201d: The cat is neither the doer or the doee here. The cat owning a toy triggers the state of possession. \u201c That book contains poems \u201d: The poems that are in the book trigger the state of containing something. Hope I explained it well enough. amra\u0306 Effector The entity is changing or affecting the patient in some way. \u201c Kate hits the cat :( \u201d Kate here has unfortunately affected the cat by hitting it. amri Reciever The entity that is recieveing something as a result of communication, transfer, transmisison or trade. Some examples: Give the dog a bone, I\u2019ll tell her your secret, The host introduced me to the guests. amri\u0308 Double-roled Simultaneously the effector and the patient. For example: \u201c She dressed herself \u201d: She both dressed someone and got dressed herself. \u201c We talked for a few minutes \u201d: That \u201cwe\u201d has both the talker and the listener inside of it so it counts. *amro\u0308* Object Tool Patient Experiencer Representer Effector Receiver Double-Rolled a o e u a\u0306 i i\u0308 o\u0308 Locational Direction of Movement To Specifies direction towards.

That\u2019s how you derive adjectives like \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201c34\u201d from \u201cgreenness\u201d or \u201c34-ness\u201d Conjunction Turns it into a conjunctor that takes two inputs from both sides. This is meant to be used with roots like \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d, but you could technically use this case with every root. Though the meaning of that conjunction would be up to the speaker. 1 For example: mre\u0328\u0308 : [cat conjunction] Equative Forms phrases like \u201c as \u2018X property\u2019 as \u2026 \u201c For example: mri\u0328\u0307\u0306k\u02b0 : as cat-ic as Khal. description conjunction equative o\u0328\u0308 e\u0328\u0308 i\u0328\u0307\u0306 Configuration When the configuration is omitted, it is assumed to be a monad (a single entity). Numbers Monad Default value. Has the consonant value -l- . Represents a single entity. amral ( amra / amr ): a cat. Dyad Represents two entities treated as a unit. amram : a pair of cats. Triad Represents three entities treated as a unit. amrag\u0302 : a group of three cats. Tetrad Represents four entities as a unit. amraz\u0307 : a group of four cats. Pentad Represents five entities as a unit. amrac\u0307 : a group of five cats. Hexad Represents six entities as a unit. amra\u0111\u02b8 : a group of six cats. Polyad Represents more than 6 entities as a unit. amrav\u02b8 : a group of more than 6 cats. Pleiad Represents one than one entity as a unit. amrav : a group of more than 1 cat. Hikanad Represents an enough amount of entities as a unit. The criteria of \u201cenough\u201d is based on context. amrap\u02b8 : an enough amout of cats Kenad Respesents zero entities as a unit. amrac\u0307\u02b0 : zero cats. Meriad Represents a fractional amount of entities as a unit. amral\u02b8 : a part of a cat. Forms Monads do not fit into any of these categories so monads are classified as vague. Relation Fused Different entities joined into a blob with no boundaries. amra\u0111 : two similar cats fused together. (by an evil scientist I suppose) Connected Either physically tied or touching, or metaphorically related. amrag : three cats either tied together, in contact, or related in some way Seperate Neither connected or fused amras\u030c\u02b8 : six unrelated seperate cats.

This mid-tone is marked by either a high-dash (\u203e) or an apostrophe (\u2018). Question verbs have 2 equivilant ways to mark question: Example: \u2018amr : to be a cat Either use the according vowel in the Case slot or Pronounce the penultimate syllable with a rising tone (marked with \u00a8 or ? at the start of the word) Example: ?amr or \u00a8amr : is X a cat? Example sentences: \u2018imr k\u02b0 : The Language of Khal is a cat toy. [verb]-sl11-'cat toy' 'khal language' Reminder k\u02b0 = k\u02b0a = k\u02b0al = ak\u02b0 = ak\u02b0a = ak\u02b0al because -a- and -l- are default values here. ?a\u0307k\u02b0 \u00f6mr : Is meowing (the same as) speaking Khal? [ques]-sl9-'khal language' sl2-'meow' C H (Collectivity + Abstraction or Numeric Operation) Values The reason palatalized consonants are nnot allowed in roots is that they are used here. So it doesn\u2019t become ambiguous whether a word is C H +STEMLET+ROOT ( t\u02b8amr ) or ROOT+CASE+CONFIG ( mrat ). Abstraction The abstract general idea of something. Has the value -t\u02b8- . \u201cI like cats\u201d. This \u201ccat\u201d isn\u2019t a specific cat, it is an idea of a cat. So it would be t\u02b8amr ( t\u02b8amra ) here. Individuality Turns \u201c\u2026 entities as one unit\u201d into individual entities. -s\u030c\u02b8- . For example: amram : a pair of cats s\u030c\u02b8amram : two cats. This allows to omit the number adjectives and embed the amount inside the word. Operations Does operations with the preceding operation. The preceding number inherits the case of the following number, so you can omit the case of the preceding number.
